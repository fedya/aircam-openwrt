Source: mg-20090107.tar.gz
Type: ipkg
Description: 	This program is intended to be a small, fast, and portable
	editor for people who can't (or don't want to) run real
	Emacs for one reason or another.  It is compatible with GNU
	because there shouldn't be any reason to learn more than
	one Emacs flavor.
